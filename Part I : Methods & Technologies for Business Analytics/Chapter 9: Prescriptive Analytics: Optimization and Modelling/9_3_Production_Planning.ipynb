        "According to the results obtained, ATK-White needs to produce 1400 units of the second product and 700 units of the fourth product in order to achieve maximum profit. In this case, the company will use all of its 7000 labor hours and 7000 units of raw materials during the planning period. In addition, regarding the agreement of the company with a customer, which required a total of at least 500 units of the first and third products or 750 units of the second and fourth products, the need can be met from production of 2100 units of the second and fourth products. Since there has been no production of the fifth product, the constraint that a maximum of 500 units of the fourth product should be produced has not been met. Furthermore, since only the second product is produced from the first and second products, the fourth product cen also be produced."
