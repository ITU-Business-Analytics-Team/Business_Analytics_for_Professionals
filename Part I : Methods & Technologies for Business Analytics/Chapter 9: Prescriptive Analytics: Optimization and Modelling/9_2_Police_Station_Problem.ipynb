        "In this example, chief officer of the Maçka Police Station will plan the shifts of the officers. Each officer works for 5 days per week in consecutive days and make a break in the following two days. The crime rate fluctuates with the day of week, so the number of the police officers required each day depends on which day of the week it is: Monday, 15; Tuesday, 18; Wednesday, 19; Thursday, 11; Friday, 21; Saturday, 16; Sunday, 11. The Chief wants to schedule police officers to minimize the total number of the officers. An LP model should be formulated for this goal."
